### Erin Stewart (MS student)
Erin’s primary research interests include animal behavior and communication, ornithology, and conservation biology. Her thesis work investigates the role of fighting ability in territorial interactions of Poliocrania exsul (chestnuyt-backed antbird) in central Panama. Prior to attending UW, Erin obtained a B.S. in Biology from the University of Puget Sound, during which she completed an undergraduate thesis on the effects of wildfire and beaver dams on stream macroinvertebrates. Subsequently, she worked as a field technician in Idaho, California, Georgia, and Florida studying Ridgway’s Rails, Greater Sage-Grouse, Ruffed Grouse, and plant demography. In addition, she is very interested in science communication and journalism, and has contributed to science magazines and blogs. When not working, she likes playing board games such as Wingspan, and, when not working AND not thinking about birds, she enjoys hiking, baking, reading travel memoirs and murder mysteries, and watching tiny house tours.
